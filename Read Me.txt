Left Mouse Button -> Holy Light - Used to tame an angry ghost
Right Mouse Button -> Exorcism Cross - Used to destroy and tame ghost

Game Play:

When destroying ghosts with the Exorcism Cross two angry ghosts will spawn for every one tame ghost destroyed.  If an angry ghost contacts a tame ghost then the tame ghost becomes angry.  If all ghosts are angry you lose the game.

Scoring:

Points are totaled by (tame ghosts - angry ghosts) and then added to your score when you use the Exorcism Cross on a tame ghost.  The more tame ghosts you have the faster your score will go up.
